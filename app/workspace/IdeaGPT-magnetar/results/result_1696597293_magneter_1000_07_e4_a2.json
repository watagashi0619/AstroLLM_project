    "question": "\nIn the field of magnetar research, the relationship between magnetar and fast radio bursts, and how much magnetar is contained in fast radio bursts, are now the focus of much attention. What kind of observation proposals would be effective for observational research using satellites such as JWST (optical), NuSTAR (hard X-ray), and NICER (soft X-ray)?\n",
    "answer": "I propose a multi-wavelength observation campaign to study magnetars and their associated fast radio bursts (FRBs). Based on the mentioned studies, FRBs have been linked to magnetars, but the exact mechanism of their emission is still unclear. \n\n1. We could use the NuSTAR satellite to observe high-energy X-ray emissions from active magnetars, such as SGR J1935+2154, as it has been suggested that these bursts are linked to FRBs (Ridnaia et al. 2020; Tavani et al. 2020). Observing these bursts could help us understand the energy mechanisms behind FRBs.\n\n2. Simultaneously, we could use the NICER satellite to observe the softer X-ray emissions from these magnetars. The correlation between soft X-ray and hard X-ray emissions could provide insight into the magnetar's internal structure and energy distribution.\n\n3. In conjunction with these X-ray observations, we could use the JWST to observe the optical emissions from these magnetars, especially during active periods. This could provide additional data on the energy spectrum of these objects and help confirm or disprove theories about the emission mechanisms of FRBs.\n\n4. Lastly, to link these observations directly to FRBs, we should coordinate these observations with radio observatories that can detect FRBs. This could allow us to directly correlate observed X-ray and optical emissions with the occurrence of FRBs.\n\nThis multi-wavelength approach would allow us to observe a broad range of emissions from these magnetars and could potentially provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind FRBs.",

The recent discovery of weak FRBs from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 [51,52] lends strong support to magnetar models. In this section, I describe how the above-outlined coherent radiation mechanisms could work in magnetars.\n\n3.1.

The notion of magnetars was introduced to astrophysics by Duncan and Thompson [53,54], who predicted that ultrastrong magnetic \ufb01elds could be generated in proto-neutron stars, and demonstrated that the decay of this \ufb01eld could feed soft gamma repeaters (for a recent review of magnetars, see [55])"

The detection of an extremely luminous radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 added credence to this hypothesis. We report on simultaneous and non-simultaneous observing campaigns using the Arecibo, E\ufb00elsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2 and Northern Cross radio telescopes and the MeerLICHT optical telescope in the days and months after the April 28 event. We did not detect any signi\ufb01cant single radio pulses down to \ufb02uence limits between 25 mJy ms and 18 Jy ms. Some observing epochs overlapped with times when X-ray bursts were detected"
